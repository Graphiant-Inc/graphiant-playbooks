# Example Vault Secrets File
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy this file to vault_secrets.yml
#    cp ansible_collections/graphiant/naas/configs/vault_secrets.yml.example ansible_collections/graphiant/naas/configs/vault_secrets.yml
# 2. Replace the example values with your actual secrets
# 3. Encrypt it with: ansible-vault encrypt ansible_collections/graphiant/naas/configs/vault_secrets.yml
#    Or create it directly encrypted: ansible-vault create ansible_collections/graphiant/naas/configs/vault_secrets.yml
# 4. Run the Site-to-Site VPN playbook with vault password:
#    ansible-playbook ansible_collections/graphiant/naas/playbooks/site_to_site_vpn.yml --tags create --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass
#    Or prompt for vault password: ansible-playbook ... --ask-vault-pass
#
# The playbook writes decrypted vars to configs/vault_site_to_site_vpn_secrets.yml (fixed name under config);
# the module reads from that file. Do not commit vault_secrets.yml or vault_site_to_site_vpn_secrets.yml.

# Site-to-Site VPN Preshared Keys
# Map VPN names (vpn_name) to their preshared keys
# IMPORTANT: The key MUST match the 'name' field in your site_to_site_vpn configuration exactly
# The presharedKey is automatically populated from this vault - you don't need to specify it in the config file
vault_site_to_site_vpn_keys:
  # Add VPN keys as needed - use the VPN name as the key:
  # vpn-name-1: "key1"
  # vpn-name-2: "key2"
  # my-vpn-connection: "my-secret-key"

# BGP MD5 Passwords (if needed for Site-to-Site VPN BGP routing)
# Map VPN names (vpn_name) to their MD5 passwords
# IMPORTANT: The key MUST match the 'name' field in your site_to_site_vpn configuration exactly
# The md5Password is automatically populated from this vault - you don't need to specify it in the config file
vault_bgp_md5_passwords:
  # Add BGP MD5 passwords as needed - use the VPN name as the key:
  # vpn-name-1: "bgp-password-1"
  # vpn-name-2: "bgp-password-2"
  # my-vpn-connection: "my-bgp-md5-password"
